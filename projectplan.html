			<div class="sectionContent">
				<p>As mentioned in our earlier detailed project overview, this project will establish a basic version of the LendIt application, allowing users to begin to connect and enjoy the concept of the app. Initially LendIt will focus on connecting the community. Users will register with the platform and list items they are interested in sharing. Potential borrowers will see a map view of people local to them and the items they have listed for borrowing.</p>

				<h1>The Approach</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<p>Whilst building the LendIT app we will take the approach of using the leanest most usable features and layer on complexity until we run out of time.</p>
				<p>As the project develops we might decide that we want one feature to be lean and another to be complex, when considering this we will consider the of 4 main factors: Scope, Time, Fidelity, and Cost. </p>
				<p>Generally, we won’t be able to change one of these factors without impacting another, but we will consider the necessary information and support to make informed decisions. </p>
				<p>The timeframe for this project is quite tight we will apply timesaving short cuts where possible – for example leveraging an existing component library over recreating one, skipping some discovery techniques, and leveraging the learnings from your existing products. </p>
				<p>We will use Design Thinking, Lean UX and Agile methodologies to guide us through the project - bringing the best practices of Cross Functional teams together. </p>
				<p>The diagram, above, highlights the process that we will be following during discovery and build. </p>

					<h2>Define</h2>
					<p>We will define the scope of the LendIt phase one project as detailed in our aims and scope sections.</p>
					<h2>Research</h2>
					<p>We will conduct market research of competitors in the market to identify a point of difference for the LendIt app.</p>
					<h2>Prioritisation</h2>
					<p>We take all our findings and insights and sort them to assess viability, desirability, and feasibility. We will identify what can be done in the timeframe and the order in which it will be built.</p>
					<h2>Identify Scope</h2>
					<p>Once the findings are sorted, we will organise them into a roadmap, identifying which opportunities need to be addressed now, in the future, or parked. </p>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>

					<p>We collaboratively create possible future solutions and visualise them in both experience level and technical level.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h2>Solution Design</h2>
					<p>Ideate and propose potential solutions based on user archetypes through ideation and process mapping exercise </p>
					<h2>Task & User Flow mapping</h2>
					<p>Ensuring each feature’s experience is designed sequentially and thoroughly, we will collaboratively define each features task flow; visualisation of specific steps undertaken to accomplish goals and picture the ideal user choice within the app.</p>
					<h2>Design Prototype</h2>
					<p>Create prototype of the LendIt app and review. In this phase we will strongly rely on our Technical Architect and QA Engineer to test the prototype before committing to the build.</p>
					<h2>User Testing</h2>
					<p>Test the designed experiences and user interface with key users to validate solution and gain fast feedback and learnings for solution iteration</p>

				<h1>Quantitative & Qualitative</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>

					<p>As the features are built, we will deploy them into the production environment (as early as possible), so we can start measuring value.</p>
					<p>The true success of an idea can only be measured once it is in the hands of our customers. If the idea is a success we move on to the next phase. If it is unsuccessful, we find out why, adjust or retire it and try again. We do this iteratively, developing the ideas, until the final product is successful.</p>
					<p>We will use a mixture of Qualitative (User Testing) and Quantitative (Analytics) data to make this assessment and we will test as features are released and as the product evolves.</p>

				<h1>Tech Approach</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>

					<p>As part of LendIt's succession plan, we will ensure that the application is up to standards when a user is using the mobile application. In developing this application, we are aware that we may encounter risks, which is why our team will do their very best to resolve any issues that may arise. During the development process of the application, we make the assumption that everyone who is going to be performing their duties makes sure that they are preparing the application for a launch when it is time.</p>
					<p>In order to keep everyone up to their game and to ensure that everyone keeps track of any technical difficulties that could arise throughout the development process of LendIt, we will be doing our best to ensure that everyone is aware of the technical challenges we may encounter. As we are developing the application, it is crucial that we open up to the risks that we may encounter along the way, which are likely to arise as we work on LendIt. We will make sure that everyone assigned to the task will participate in the meeting if there is a risk, regardless of whether it is a technological, financial or security issue. The meeting will be used to ensure that everyone involved with the task is aware of the problem so that we can all work together towards a solution.</p>
					<p>As we are very picky about who we should include in our development team, the people that are involved in the LendIt developing team have all kinds of experience and we are very keen on choosing the right people. It is important to point out that in order to develop LendIt, we have included the most experienced team, which is dedicated to everything that we need. The team is a pleasure to work with as they have an amazing background experience and have demonstrated a lot of performance in the past, making it an absolute pleasure to launch the application together.</p>
					<p>Unlike UberEats, Deliveroo, Etc. LendIt’s customer benefits will be concentrating on delivering clothes to anyone who is in an inconvenient situation. Our focus will be making sure that the application itself is a safe browse with enhanced quality, improved performance, as well as making sure that the cost is appropriate according to any listing products including service fees and delivery fees, could potentially have a membership for cheaper fees, reduce potential risks that is involved with releasing the product and increasing the satisfaction of the customers and or stakeholders.</p>
					<p>Having a vision is just what we are doing right now, and that’s setting high standards for LendIt to produce and deliver in the best way possible, as well as becoming as convenient to the users as possible, and letting them rely on it to get the job done. There is no doubt that we as a team believe that this is what the people need in their everyday lives, regardless of whether they are renting the product or purchasing it, we are taking the necessary steps to make it possible for everyone to get this application, and that’s what the people are missing, so this is what we are happy to deliver to the public.</p>

				<h1>Design and Discovery</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>

					<p>There is no doubt that Design and Discovery plays a very important role in ensuring that design projects get started in the right direction by focusing on the right problems and building the right solutions. We would underline the importance of LendIt’s broad and technology-driven approach in order to be effective. We are ensuring that any solution that is suggested later will fit the needs of users, will be feasible for the development team and will be feasible for LendIt that will be released. There will be a number of things included in the discovery process as a result:</p>
					<h2>Understanding of users</h2>
					<p>The goal of user research is for our team to understand who it is that is experiencing a given problem, how it affects them, and what they need and value from a solution that seeks to solve the issue.</p>
					<h2>Solving problems and taking advantage of opportunities</h2>
					<p>By carrying out investigative work, our team is able to understand the causes of the problems, and the effects have on the users. It is able to recognise the magnitude of an issue and the opportunities that can be found within an organisation, product, or service in order to solve it.</p>
					<h2>Shared Vision</h2>
					<p>We work closely with stakeholders during the discovery process in order to understand their business objective and the desired outcomes. Taking this approach allows our team to focus on the problem that will have a huge impact on the outcome, and therefore come up with a solution based on that. After our team has analysed the problem, they will have an idea of what to do going forward, understanding the solution.</p>

				<h1>Develop and Deliver</h1>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Develop</h2>
					<p>It will be time for us to move into the strategy phase of the project once everyone in our team has understood what needs to be accomplished. In terms of executing this phase, the team has countless number of options, but we decided to list the following areas:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Strategy:</b> A great deal of LendIt’s marketing strategy will be based on a plethora of options, including a blog, social media marketing, app store optimisation and influencer marketing. </li>
						<li>Impact: In the hopes that everything will be executed properly within our given strategy so that LendIt will have an outstanding performance in every aspect, we as a team are optimistic that we will be able to reach our goals.</li>
					</ul>
					<p></p>
					<h2>Deliver</h2>
					<p>During our discussion of our strategy for LendIt, we will also discuss the tactics that we have in place to ensure that we keep our aim on achieving success.</p>
					<h2>What will happen next?</h2>
					<p>It is our intention as soon as LendIt is fully implemented that we will evaluate every change that has been made, any bugs that people on our team have encountered and any possible slight changes in the plan that are possible.</p>
					<h2>Milestones</h2>
					<p>As soon as LendIt is released for the public to use, we will be relying on people’s feedback, as we are also listening to the consumers that use the application because we would like to make sure that the application continues to be reliable for those who are new to LendIt. After everything is going according to plan, making sure the app is up-to-date with any iOS or Android update to ensure its compatibility with the latest phones, and based on the number of downloads by our users, we will be considering implementing a membership to reward our users who use LendIt.</p>
					<h2>Development Activities</h2>
					<p>As part of an effective development activity, it is imperative that we gather as much information as we can from the people we will be interviewing for role or the skills that they wish to develop, and we will be able to pinpoint the perfect people for the job. There will be a number of development activities that will be carried out, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Job Rotation</li>
						<li>Coaching</li>
						<li>Mentoring</li>
						<li>Learning Group</li>
						<li>Self Development</li>
						<li>Training</li>
					</ul>
					<p></p>
					<p>It has been found that the development activities listed above are essential for LendIt as it also offers interaction with other people and helps refresh the mind of people in order to perform their roles and gain new skills to enhance our application. </p>
