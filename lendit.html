					<p>LendIt aims to be the go-to app for all single-use community borrowing needs. It will provide a revenue stream for owners of seldom used items by providing a means to share these with others in their community looking to borrow them.</p>
					<div id="screenshot">

<p></p>
					<p>These items will generally be of reasonable value where purchase for one-time use is not viable by potential borrowers. </p>
					<p>A key goal of LendIt is to provide a service that is simple to use. The user experience will a key decision point for any features and functionality deployed. Providing a platform that minimises end-user friction is crucial for attracting and retaining customers. </p>
					<p>LendIt will be developed utilising Agile Methodology to deploy a minimal viable product (MVP) and build on functionality with continual iterations and phased deployment.</p>
					<p> We envisage it will be built in four phases, with each phase consisting of the following stages: </p>
					<ol font="bold">
						<li align="justify">Frame: We uncover and prioritise desired functionality</li>
						<li align="justify">Discover: We discover, experiment, refine and test the functionality</li>
						<li align="justify">Develop: We build, test and deploy features early and often </li>
						<li align="justify">Measure: We celebrate the success or adjust, pivot or retire failures </li>
						<p></p>
					</ol>

					<p>Konrad brings a wealth of experience in IT sales and business development. He looks for purpose in his work and likes to go about his business with integrity. Although introverted, he enjoys deep connections and can provide insightful advice when called upon. He is also a budding musician and enjoys creative endeavours. </p>
					<p>Assuming the accuracy of the Myers Briggs personality profiles, we are indeed a well-rounded team with personal attributes that complement each other. With two Diplomats, a Sentinel and an Explorer, we cover three of the four high-level MBTI roles with the Analyst the only omission. However, with Meghan as our resident Logistician, we have someone who thrives in facts and structure. Among us we bring a healthy balance of structure, creativity, harmony and strategic thinking to ensure team success.</p>
