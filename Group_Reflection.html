					<h1>Group Reflection</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Our group name, Everywhere Australia, is derived from one of our biggest challenges – figuring out what time our meetings were in each of our local time zones! Being a team with individuals from literally ‘everywhere in Australia’, we were just about able to commit to meeting up over MS Teams twice a week to discuss the assignment, distribute work and understand how we were each progressing with our assigned tasks. </p>
					<p>Although a challenge, as a team this is one aspect that we felt worked well towards working together to get the assignment completed. Within our weekly catchups we rotated the chair of the meeting between Konrad & Meghan, our structured agenda included: check-in on progress; what help is needed and what do we want done by the next meeting, with any additional issues being raised by team members in the catch-up. We feel as a group we were able to use these meetings effectively and equally distribute the work between ourselves. </p>
					<p>Throughout the assignment we also believe that a strength of ours has been clear communication. For example, in our first meeting when we initially met as a team, both Vincent and Jason were open to say they would prefer not to chair the group but were happy to contribute to the weekly meetings and get on with the work. This clear communication within the group has let us progress with defined roles / personalities within the group.</p>
					<p>With this in mind, one thing that has surprised us as a group is how easily we have got on and been able to work together without clashes. On reflection, the clear communication in the group has aided this as people have been open and honest and delivered work agreed to and if someone has a questions, is struggling or does not have the capacity to complete assigned work this has been communicated so other team members can assist in a timely manner. Opposed to say, a team member dropping off the face of the earth and the remaining members are not sure if they are continuing with their work or not.</p>
					<p>One aspect we would look to improve for our next assignment is we would aim to have work completed at an earlier date, so we have more time to evaluate and fine tune our work before submitting the assignment. This is an aspect we will learn from and improve on our next assignment.</p>

					<p>I feel as a group we predominantly have worked very well to get this assignment over the line to a high standard. On reflection, comparing both assignment two and three, I feel our assignment three has been completed collectively to a higher standard. I am proud that we have worked better, setting shorter more regular deadlines for smaller amounts of work to complete the whole assignment to a good standard and on time. We have had some issues with communication in the group, if I were to do another group project, I would overcome this by reaching out to group members earlier in the project to get the momentum going with more time ahead, to deal with these issues sooner rather than later to not cause detriment to the team's performance. However, overall, I am happy with the contribution of the team and feel we have worked well throughout the duration of the Introduction to IT course.</p>

			<p>It was great to see that the group worked hard throughout Assignment 3 and did their best to get the job done in the given time frame while also adapting to some miscommunication in our small group as well. In comparison with what we did in the last assignment, it seems to me that we have adapted to quite a few things, and we have worked together better as a team than before. The problem was miscommunication is that I ought to have anticipated that this would happen based on any inconveniences that might have occurred and I should have worked to complete this assignment immediately after we had finished our last assignment. However, I have accepted it and I believe that we have done our best to complete this assignment. Despite the miscommunication, I am happy to still be working with the group as their expertise is very valuable to the assignment and I am thankful for everything that they have to offer to the group, and we managed to work together in the most effective way possible. </p>

<div class="sectionContent">
	<p>It was great to see my group do well even though I wasn’t the best in the team during this assignment. There were many times where I could’ve done better during this assignment e.g., let the team know that I was having problems with internet or asking the team if there was a meeting on the day. Although communication could be improved a bit more, I believe that it was a strong point within the team during the second half of the assignment. Meghan and Konrad who were the leaders of the group did really well to assign deadlines and lead the group. Jason also did really well by stepping forward to ask for more work as he thought that he didn’t have enough during this assignment which helped lessen the burden on Konrad and Meghan. If we were to do another assignment, I believe that I would need to start pulling my weight in the group and try to do the same as Jason and take up some more work to myself. I believe that our group did better in assignment 1 collectively as in assignment 2 the first week had a rough start. Overall, this assignment taught me that deadlines are really important and group communication is key in a good working group.</p>

	<p>I was most surprised by the difficulty it was for us to all meet at common times, based on time zones and availability. In the past six years I have never had to travel for work as much as I have in this past month or two, which is frustrating that it has caused this difficulty arranging times with group work. This assignment in particular has felt more disjointed than the first, with finding time to meet even more difficult. It seems we collectively worked on this project in isolation, which is ok as we all still did our bit to the job done. What was missing however was a sense of team. Next time we can do a better job collectively on finding a way to all get together. I do think that we were smarter this time around with work sharing and allocation. We utilised Tasks with Microsoft Teams early to make everyone knew what needed to happen.</p>
