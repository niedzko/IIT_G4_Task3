					<h1>Scope</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>There are many factors in the production of this project that may need to come into play that will help decide how the final project will come out. This will be judged by the scopes and limits that will be implemented into the project plan. The way that we will decide the scopes and limits is section them into different phases from one to four. Phase one will be focusing on getting the community into the LendIt App. This means that users will be able to register into the app and be able to list items to others that are interested in them. Also, people who rent items will be able to see a map of people close to them and the items they have available for rent. Overall, the first phase will include a database for people to create an account to rent, borrow and chat where people can also look at a map to see people near them. We also have further plans for phases 2-4 but it falls outside the scope for phase one.</p>

					<h1>Tools & Technology</h1>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>In order to ensure that the mobile application runs smoothly on all devices, Lendit is expected to have a successful and outstanding software solution. As we develop our mobile application, we will be using Kobiton, which is an excellent tool that prevents bugs before pushing code to testing, ensuring that our application provides the best performance and visual test automation. In addition to this, it will allow us to fix any issues before they are released for production, and it will allow us to deploy and start testing in a matter of minutes, with smooth CI/CD integrations. Throughout the entire development process, we will be relying on the Kobiton licensing. Therefore, we will be able to take advantage of the following solutions as a result:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Test the app on a real device in the cloud using real devices</li>
						<li>Tests of Functionality, performance, and visuality that are automated and can either be scriptless or scripted</li>
						<li>The ability to debug on real devices within your IDE for rapid debugging</li>
						<li>It provides various features such as Customisable Test Cloud, Rich Test Logs, Agile Test Enabler, Optimised Efficiency, Secure Platform, Mobile Device Testing, Device Lab Management, and Bug tracking. among others.</li>
					</ul>
					<p></p>
					<p>It is also noteworthy that the success of this type of development will not require any hardware from the user to ensure our success.</p>

				<h1>Testing</h1>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<p>With the testing of the LendIt app, we have developed the attached user story board of how we envisage the customer journey would play out. Please see attachment <a href="LendIt Customer Journey Map.pdf" target="_blank">LendIt Customer Journey Map</a>. We would plan on testing our customer journey before and whilst developing the application to make sure that this covers all functionality required in V1 before fully building and commissioning LendIt. </p>
					<p>We would achieve this by utilising our QA Engineer to develop a test plan to test both the user interface and backend of the app ensuring it functions in the best way possible for the user. We will then modify and develop the app to overcome any issues we identify in the early stages of this project through till the application launch.</p>
					<p>Once we have undergone excessive testing internally on the application, we would look to undergo some user testing to ensure that there is nothing our QA Engineer has missed being too close to the project. We would source a broad demographic for testing as LendIt will be marketed towards a range of user groups. For example, we will have a range of products on the app which will be accessible by a broad demographic of people from different backgrounds and age groups. It will be important to know that LendIt is as easy to use for a teenager as it is a pensioner.</p>

				<h1>Risks</h1>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<p>In any development process, there are several risks involved in ensuring an application can run smoothly and without problems. There is a good chance that we can be easily blinded by the number of possibilities that Kobiton offers, making us believe that this software will be an ideal tool for us to use with the least number of hassles possible. As a result, we have identified the following examples that could pose a potential risk for the development of our application:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Authentication and authorisation are not good enough.</li>
						<li>Data being stored and encrypted incorrectly.</li>
						<li>Third-party libraries.</li>
						<li>There is no binary protection in the software.</li>
						<li>A risk of being denied using the software.</li>
						<li>There is a possibility that the app will not work properly</li>
						<li>Poor UX/UI</li>
					</ul>

				<article>
					<p>Everywhere Australia are based quite literally everywhere in Australia, meaning it is not possible for us to meet face-to-face to discuss the project progress. However, we have two scheduled meetings each week, one on a Monday and Thursday. The team will attend these sessions to discuss / distribute work and raise any concerns or goals with the wider team. We then utilise MS Teams and the gantt chart to allocate tasks, set deadlines and see how our fellow team members are progressing with tasks in the project. If a team member is not to respond to the team / attend the scheduled meetings, we will continue to try reach out and if required notify the tutor to act on this to not cause detriment to the wider team / progress of the project.</p>
