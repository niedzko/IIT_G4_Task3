						<h1>Team Profile</h1>
					</div>

					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p>Everywhere Australia consists of four distinct personalities:</p>

						<ol>
							<li> <a href="https://meghancatterick.github.io/IITA1/" target="_blank">Meghan Catterick</a></li>
							<li> <a href="https://hackerman24816.github.io/Intro-to-IT-A1/ " target="_blank">Vincent Chieu</a></li>
							<li> <a href="https://1jasoner1.github.io/" target="_blank">Jason Samaan</a></li>
							<li> <a href="https://niedzko.github.io/IITA1/" target="_blank">Konrad Niedzwiedz</a></li>
						<p></p>
						</ol>
						<p>We all come from diverse backgrounds and experience levels, bringing a unique blend of attributes to our collective team.
						<p>Meghan (s3972670) recently relocation to Australia from the UK and is looking to immerse herself into the IT industry. Having a strong background in IT recruitment, she has a unique perspective into the skills and experience required to succeed in this industry. She brings a project management background and tenacity to get the job done - as demonstrated by her undefeated boxing career!</p>
						<p>Vincent (s3977557) is from a Chinese and Vietnamese family and brings the creative flair to our group. His love of music and abilities as a piano player demonstrate his abilities to work independently and to progressively build his skills. He brings a natural curiosity and passion to all he does.</p>
						<p>Jason (s3979969) is the big-picture thinker of the team and is called to a greater purpose, as is demonstrated by his volunteer work. While he is a visionary and can see the big picture, he also likes to bring his team mates on the journey and enjoyed watching them reach their full potential. A great team-player.</p>
						<p>Konrad (s3973905) brings a wealth of experience in IT sales and business development. He looks for purpose in his work and likes to go about his business with integrity. Although introverted, he enjoys deep connections and can provide insightful advice when called upon. He is also a budding musician and enjoys creative endeavours. </p>

						<h1>Group Process</h1>
					</div>

					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p>During assignment 2 we worked effectively as a group to use our bi-weekly meetings to equally distribute the work between ourselves. Throughout the assignment we also had clear and open communication, e.g. in our first meeting when we initially met as a team, both Vincent and Jason were open to say they would prefer not to chair the group but were happy to contribute to the weekly meetings and get on with the work. This clear communication within the group has let us progress with defined roles / personalities within the group.</p>
						<p>With this in mind, one thing that has surprised us as a group is how easily we have got on and been able to work together without clashes. On reflection, the clear communication in the group has aided this as people have been open and honest and delivered work agreed to and if someone has a questions, is struggling or does not have the capacity to complete assigned work this has been communicated so other team members can assist in a timely manner. Opposed to say, a team member dropping off the face of the earth and the remaining members are not sure if they are continuing with their work or not.</p>
						<p>One aspect we are hoping to change / improve on for this assignment 3 is we would aim to have work completed at an earlier date, so we have more time to evaluate and fine tune our work before submitting the assignment. </p>

				<h1>Career Plans</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<p>Meghan’s goal is to pursue a career within IT Project Management and currently has one years’ experience as a digital project manager, managing projects end-to-end, engaging with stakeholders and following a structured approach under strict deadlines. </p>
				<p>Vincent would like to work in the area of Technician, O.C.M.S End User Computing. While he was in school doing his elective, Vincent developed a keen interest in IT that led him to pursue a career in IT. Even though, Vincent does not have any experience or skills that would make him an ideal candidate for his ideal job, that does not stop him from learning and achieving what he requires in order to reach his goals. </p>
				<p>Jason is working to achieve a successful career in Cyber Security, he has always been interested in IT and it was his choice to take an elective studying IST in high school which motivated me to learn more about it and continue to study it after graduation. From there he spent a lot of time reading articles on reddit about cybersecurity, which led him to gain a greater interest in networking.</p>
				<p>Konrad has set his sights on working as a Technology Strategist. In terms of experience, Konrad currently works in a business development role, which involves selling workplace technology. This demonstrates his ability to build relationships, establish trust, and listen to customers' requirements in order to translate them into sound strategic initiatives.</p>
			<p>Similarities drawn from our team's career plans are that both Meghan and Konrad’s careers are similar in the sense that these require softer skills such as stakeholder engagement, relationship building, whilst also having a strong technical knowledge and understanding of technology. Jason and Vincent’s roles are similar as they are more ‘hands-on’, with updating, maintaining and programming systems. All of these career paths would compliment nicely in a project delivery team, Konrad would work with the customer to design and scope the solution, this would then be passed to Meghan to manage the project delivery for the customer, within the delivery team would sit Jason responsible for the software security and Vincent to build, customise and maintain the product for the customer.</p>
